"Here is my SQL schema and the API script, which serve as the foundation for the entire player and website functionality. Based on this structure, I need you to create a robust and fully functional video quality switching feature.

Key Requirements:

1. SQL Schema Analysis:

Review the provided SQL schema to understand how the video data, including quality URLs (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p, Max), is stored and retrieved.

Ensure that the database is properly structured to support multiple quality options for each video.



2. API Script Review:

Examine the API script thoroughly to understand how it fetches video data from the database and delivers it in response to API calls.

Identify the structure of the JSON response, ensuring that it includes all necessary quality URLs for seamless integration.



3. Quality Switching Functionality:

Implement a feature that dynamically fetches and displays available video quality options (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p, Max) based on the API response.

Ensure the player can seamlessly switch to the selected video quality by updating the video source URL without reloading the page or interrupting playback.



4. UI Integration:

Add a quality selection button in the player controls. The button should open a dropdown or menu showing all available qualities.

Design the dropdown to blend seamlessly with the playerâ€™s theme and maintain a user-friendly interface.



5. Performance Optimization:

Optimize the quality switching function to ensure it operates smoothly without increasing the website's load time or player performance issues.

Minimize API calls and ensure efficient handling of the video source URLs.



6. Testing and Debugging:

Test the entire quality switching process, including API integration and SQL data retrieval.

Debug any issues related to database queries, API responses, or player functionality to ensure a seamless experience.



7. Documentation:

Provide clear and concise documentation of how the quality switching feature works, including details about database changes, API updates, and player integration.




Approach this task systematically, ensuring the feature is aligned with the SQL schema and API script, and delivers a flawless video quality switching experience for the user."
